## 🍎 Original iOS/macOS Version

This app is an Android adaptation of **TimesTable+** originally built for iOS and macOS by [numbfede](https://github.com/numbfede/TimesTable--by-numbfede). The original version is built with SwiftUI and SwiftData and supports features like Siri Shortcuts, a home screen widget, and Mac Catalyst. If you're on Apple platforms, check out the original — it's what this port is based on.
